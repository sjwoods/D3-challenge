          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Low-income households are more likely to be under insured than higher income households, 
            howevever, not all under insured adults are in families with low incomes. Texas has the highest number of 
            under insured adults, but does not have the highest number of families in poverty. Therefore, the correlation 
            of being insured has other factors than income.</p>

          <p>In the U.S., people living below the poverty level have higher rates of cigarette smoking than the general 
            population. However, poverty does not appear to be the only factor that contributes to the likelihood of 
            cigarette smoking. States like California and New York fall around the median in terms of poverty rates, 
            but have some of the lowest rates of smoking relative to their populations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is one of the wealthiest countries in the world and has high obesity rates; 
            one-third of the population is considered obese. It has been suggested that 
            individuals who live in impoverished regions have poor access to fresh food. Poverty-dense areas are often
            times called â€œfood deserts", implying diminished access to fresh food. Again, there are states, such as New
            Hampshire, that have very low poverty rates but still have relatively higher rates of obesity.</p>
